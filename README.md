# OnlineDataCollect
A shiny app designed to collect data in a manner similar to google forms. 

One limitation of Google Forms is that the form does not allow for dynamic items. In cases where users' responses limit the items they can validly respond to in multiple response items or grid items, the form still presents them with all items for response. This extends the completion time for the survey and reduces the consumer experience. Therefore the aim of this app to integrate dynamically created UI items to reduce the time it takes to complete the form, thereby improving user experience.
